# Humidity-and-Temperature-Analysis
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an analysis of humidity and temperature data from a car's sensor readings. The data is preprocessed, visualized, and analyzed to understand the relationships between humidity, temperature, and vehicle speed.

# Requirements
To run the Jupyter Notebook, you need the following Python libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:


#Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis should be in CSV format with the following columns:

Time
Temp[Â°C]
Hum[%]
Speed[km/h]
Replace the data_dir variable in the Jupyter Notebook with the path to your dataset directory.

# Notebook Content
The Jupyter Notebook consists of the following sections:

1-Density Plot: Creates a density plot of temperature data using Seaborn.
2-Temperature vs Speed Analysis: Plots the temperature and speed data on a dual-axis chart.
3-Humidity Dataset Preprocessing: Cleans the humidity dataset by removing outliers.
4-Humidity vs Speed Analysis: Plots the humidity and speed data on a dual-axis chart.

# Usage
Clone the repository or download the Jupyter Notebook.
Install the required Python libraries.
Replace the data_dir variable with the path to your dataset directory.
Run the Jupyter Notebook to perform the analysis and visualize the results.

# Output
The output of the Jupyter Notebook includes various plots saved as JPEG images:

Density Plot of Temperature Data
Temperature vs Speed Chart
Humidity Dataset Preprocessing and Outlier Removal
Humidity vs Speed Chart
